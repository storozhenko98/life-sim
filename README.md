# life-sim
A simulation to study the effects of co-operation and competition among organisms. Philosophy will be added. 

Run sim.py | For best experience, do it in a full screen terminal & set x=100 y=60 steps=500 density= 30
Resource density works best between 20 and 50. Make sure grid is at least 10 by 10.
